**Variables and constants** are used to hold pieces of data. Variables can change over time (mutable), while constants must stay the same (immutable). The word "variables" is usually used to describe both variables and constants. Variables that belong to a [struct](/structs-and-classes), [class](/structs-and-classes), or [enum](/enums) are [properties](/properties).

### Variables

Variables are declared with `var`:

```swift
var greeting "Hello"
var numberOfToys = 8
var isMorning = true
```

Variable declarations can include [type annotations](/type-annotations) for clarity:

```swift
var greeting: String "Hello"
var numberOfToys: Int = 8
var isMorning: Bool = true
```

Variables are mutable. Their values can change:

```swift
var numberOfToys: Int = 8
numberOfToys += 1
print(numberOfToys) // Prints "9"
```

### Constants

Constants are declared with `let`:

```swift
let greeting "Hello"
let numberOfToys = 8
let isMorning = true
```

Constant declarations can include [type annotations](/type-annotations) for clarity:

```swift
let greeting: String "Hello"
let numberOfToys: Int = 8
let isMorning: Bool = true
```

Constants are **not** mutable. Their values cannot change:

```swift
let numberOfToys: Int = 8
numberOfToys += 1 // ‚ùå Error: numberOfToys is not mutable
```

### Computed variables (`get` and `set`)

_Computed variables_ are like normal variables, but instead of actually storing a value, they provide a getter and (optional) setter that returns a value and set other properties indirectly.

In the example below, `age` is computed from `birthday` when it's requested. Because there is no setter, the keyword `get` can be omitted:

```swift
import Foundation

let df = DateFormatter()
df.dateFormat = "d MMMM yyyy"

var birthday = df.date(from: "5 June 1999")!

var age: Int {
  Calendar.current
    .dateComponents([.year],
                    from: birthday,
                    to: Date()).year!
}

print(age) // 20
birthday = df.date(from: "5 June 2002")!
print(age) // 17
```

In the example below, `distanceInFeet` has both a getter and a setter. Because there is a setter, the keyword `get` is required for the getter:

```swift
var distanceInMeters: Float = 100

var distanceInFeet: Float {
  get {
    distanceInMeters * 3.28
  }

  set(newDistanceInFeet) {
    distanceInMeters = newDistanceInFeet / 3.28
  }
}

print(distanceInMeters) // 100.0
print(distanceInFeet) // 328.0

distanceInFeet = 250
print(distanceInMeters) // 76.21951
print(distanceInFeet) // 250.0

distanceInMeters = 800
print(distanceInMeters) // 800.0
print(distanceInFeet) // 2624.0
```
